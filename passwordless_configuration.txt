1.in host file we can add "ansible_become_pass=password" so that we dont have type password again and again.
2.if most of the hosts having same passwords so we can create a hosts variable
example: 
[servers:vars]
ansible_ssh_pass=password #this is for when we are using password authentication
ansible_become_pass=password # this is for when we are using passwordless authentication
